## Features

- **Modern UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a responsive and attractive user interface.
- **MVI Architecture**: Follows the MVI pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Hilt to simplify dependency management.
- **Networking**: Integrates Retrofit for efficient API calls.
- **Room Database**: Supports local data storage with Room.
- **Coroutines**: Utilizes Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- **Flow**: Implements Kotlin Flow for reactive programming.

## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **MVI Architecture**: An architecture pattern that helps manage state in a predictable way.
- **Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- **Room**: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For managing background tasks and asynchronous programming.
- **Kotlin Flow**: For handling streams of data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **app**: Contains the main application code.
  - **di**: Dependency injection setup using Hilt.
  - **data**: Data layer including models and repositories.
  - **ui**: User interface components using Jetpack Compose.
  - **viewmodel**: ViewModel classes for managing UI-related data.
  
- **build.gradle**: Gradle configuration files for dependencies and build settings.

## Usage

This template serves as a starting point for your Android applications. You can customize it to fit your specific needs:

1. **Modify UI Components**: Update the UI elements in the `ui` directory to match your design.
2. **API Integration**: Update the Retrofit service interface in the `data` directory to connect to your backend.
3. **Add New Features**: Expand the app by adding new screens and functionalities.
